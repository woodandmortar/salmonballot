    <h5>Artist</h5>
    <p>Artists enrich our lives and culture through their creativity and unique visions. Their innovations inspire new
      ideas and technologies that can drive economic growth. Artistic expression fosters dialogue, brings communities together,
       and promotes diversity and inclusion. Supporting the arts ecosystem creates jobs, attracts tourism, and allows local businesses
        to thrive. Investment in the arts is thus an investment in the health, vibrancy and economic stability of society as a whole.</p>

    <h5>Activist</h5>
    <p>Activists drive social progress and reforms that create more just, equitable and sustainable economic structures. By advocating
       for the needs of marginalized groups, the environment, and ethical business practices, activists play a vital role in holding corporations
        and governments accountable. This pushes society as a whole towards greater empathy, responsibility and prosperity for all. When economic
         gains are shared broadly, and economic systems work for both people and planet, society becomes more resilient. Activists help ensure economic
         stability is never achieved at the expense of humanity or nature.</p>

    <h5>Thinker</h5>
    <p>Progressive perspectives that challenge established systems foster innovation and evolution towards
      more equitable growth models. Left leaning thinkers advocating for the vulnerable provide a vital counterbalance
       to unchecked capitalism. Their ideas help ensure economic stability is built upon ethical, just foundations - not simply material gains.</p>

  Back and forth, back and forth. Your body rocks in silent, empty, blackness but the longer it goes on the more you realize it isn’t silent, empty, or black. Each sway brings a beep, rhythmic and calm but rousing. Each beep pulls you further from the sway. You aren’t in blackness, the orange-tinted black of the back of your eyelids tells you there is dim light behind your closed eyes. Your breathing is low and as you become aware of it, a burning dryness erupts in your throat and stretches up into your sinuses. Your body aches, heavy and sore almost weighing you down to the crisp, rough sheets on the bed you have to be on.
